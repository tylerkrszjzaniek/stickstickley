# A Date with Stick Stickley v. 0.1

#### Hello and welcome to my first independent project.

##### *A Date with Stick Stickley* is a very simple "game" where the player makes choices in order to win the favor of the persnickety Stick Stickley (pictured below).

Be careful as there is only one correct choice! Have fun!
